## How to Contribute

The guidelines below apply to human or automated contributions:

   - Clear descriptions and reproducible steps are highly appreciated.

2. **Submit Pull Requests:**
   - Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
   - Implement your changes, ensuring you follow the existing coding style and standards.
   - Add tests to cover any new functionality.
   - Update documentation if your changes affect usage or workflow behavior.

## Guidelines

- **Code Quality:**  
  - Ensure there are tests that cover your changes and any likely new cases they introduce.
  - When making a change remain consistent with the existing code style and structure.
  - When adding new functionality, consider if some unused or superseded code should be removed.

- **Compatibility:**  
  - Ensure your code runs on Node 20 and adheres to ECMAScript Module (ESM) standards.
  - Tests use vitest and competing test frameworks should not be added.
  - Mocks in tests must not interfere with other tests.

- **Testing:**
  - The command `npm test` should invoke the tests added for the new functionality (and pass).
  - If you add new functionality, ensure it is covered by tests.

- **Documentation:**
  - When making a change to the main source file, review the readme to see if it needs to be updated and if so, update it.
  - Where the source exports a function, consider that part of the API of the library and document it in the readme.
  - Where the source stands-up an HTTP endpoint, consider that part of the API of the library and document it in the readme.
  - Include usage examples including inline code usage and CLI and HTTP invocation, API references.

- **README:**
  - The README should begin with something inspired by the mission statement, and describing the current state of the repository (rather than the journey)
  - The README should include a link to MISSION.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, SETUP.md, and LICENSE.
  - The README should include a link to the intent√Øon `agentic-lib` GitHub Repository which is https://github.com/xn-intenton-z2a/agentic-lib.
