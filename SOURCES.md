# AWS SQS and Lambda Integration Documentation
## https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-sqs/index.html
## https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html
Integrated reference combining the AWS SDK v3 SQS client API and Lambda SQS event source mapping guide. The SQS client docs detail SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, DeleteMessage, batch operations, middleware customization, error classification, and retry modes. The Lambda mapping guide explains batch size configuration, concurrency controls, visibility timeouts, DLQ integration, retry behavior on partial failures, idempotency strategies, and scaling considerations. Together, they provide actionable patterns for building at-least-once, fault-tolerant event-processing pipelines. Last reviewed June 2024; maintained by AWS.
