- Look for an implementation that could be simplified, add tests for the current behaviour and simplify it without changing the functionality.
- Look for code that could be simplified using a library and introduce that library.
- Find anything that might be a "simulated" or "demo" implementation and switch to a real implementation.
- Consider alternate code paths that could be explicitly handled to improve clarity of purpose.
