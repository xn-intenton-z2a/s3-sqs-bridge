# DB_CONNECTIONS

## Overview
This enhancement consolidates database connection management by merging robust exponential backoff retries with a connection pooling mechanism. It updates the approach used for PostgreSQL connections to reduce overhead with repeated client creation while maintaining the existing exponential backoff strategy. This leads to improved performance, efficient resource utilization, and greater resilience under high load.

## Source File Updates (src/lib/main.js)
- Replace individual Client creation with a pg Pool from the pg module. Configure the pool using environment variables if provided (e.g., PG_POOL_SIZE) and default settings.
- Update the connectWithRetry function to obtain a client from the pool instead of creating a new Client each time. Ensure proper release of pooled clients after operations.
- Integrate the existing exponential backoff mechanism within the retryOperation function when obtaining a connection from the pool and executing queries. The computeRetryDelay function remains responsible for calculating wait times between retries.
- Enhance logging to include information about pool usage and connection reuse, while preserving sensitive data masking for the PostgreSQL connection string.

## Test File Updates (tests/unit/main.test.js)
- Add or update unit tests to simulate the behavior of a pooled database connection. Verify that connections are obtained from the pool and that the pooling mechanism is integrated with the retry logic.
- Include tests that ensure a client is released back to the pool after successful queries and that failures trigger both a retry and proper connection handling.

## Documentation Updates (README.md and docs/USAGE.md)
- Update documentation to explain the new connection pooling feature and its benefits. Include details on new environment variables (eg. PG_POOL_SIZE) if used.
- Provide usage examples that highlight improved performance and reduced overhead in high-load scenarios.

## Benefits
- Reduces overhead by reusing existing database connections.
- Enhances performance under concurrent load by minimizing connection setup latency.
- Improves resilience when transient errors occur by combining exponential backoff with pooled connections.
- Simplifies database connection management while preserving existing robust retry and logging functionalities.
