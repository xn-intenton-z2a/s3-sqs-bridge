# Usage: ./scripts/deactivate-schedule.sh <schedule-number>
# Example: ./scripts/deactivate-schedule.sh 1
# (deactivates schedule-1 by commenting out lines ending with "# schedule-1".)
#
# This script processes all .yml files in the .github/workflows directory.
# It looks for lines with cron schedule definitions ending with a comment like "# schedule-N"
# and, if N matches the given parameter, adds a leading "#" (if not already present) to comment out the line.
#
# Tested on macOS (zsh).
