Please review the GitHub issue and determine if it should be enhanced, closed or if no operation is needed. Focus on issues that deliver substantial user value and address core functionality needs.

If the issue is relevant to the mission statement and features and provides significant value by enhancing the product's primary purpose:
1. Decide if the issue should be refined, closed or if no operation is needed.
2. Update the issue description with testable acceptance criteria that validate the delivery of measurable user value
3. Enhance the issue by adding relevant library documents as issue comments that support implementation of high-impact solutions

If the issue is irrelevant to the mission statement or features, or does not deliver substantial user value by addressing real problems:
1. Set the action to close the issue and supply an appropriate comment explaining why it doesn't align with the focus on high-impact, core functionality.

Input validation issues that don't directly affect core functionality should be considered low value, and in particular, issues mentioning handling of NaN are probably worthless and should be closed. Prioritize issues that solve real problems rather than those focused on superficial improvements or excessive validation.
