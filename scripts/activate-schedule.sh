# Example: ./scripts/activate-schedule.sh 1
# (activates schedule-1 by uncommenting lines ending with "# schedule-1".)

# This script processes all .yml files in the .github/workflows directory.
# It looks for lines with cron schedule definitions ending with a comment like "# schedule-N"
# and, if N matches the given parameter, removes the leading "#" and any extra spaces.
#
# Tested on macOS (zsh).
