Please generate the title and description of a GitHub issue which will be used to further the development of the named feature. Focus on high-impact aspects that deliver substantial user value and address core functionality needs.
The GitHub issue description should be clear, concise, and actionable, providing a roadmap for implementation using a single invocation of an LLM to obtain the updated source files, test files, dependency files, and documentation to and deliver the desired feature.
You may only give instructions in the issues to only change the source file, test file, README file, and dependency file content. You may not create issues that request new files, delete existing files, or change the other files provided in the prompt context.
Examine the details in the named feature in the current feature names and specifications, and evaluate the current state of the repository to determine which changes will implement the feature and allow its value to be realized. Prioritize changes that directly enhance the product's primary purpose rather than superficial improvements.
The issue will be resolved by an LLM which can process over 200,000 tokens of context, and it will provide completed source files in the response.
Do not include steps that would need to be taken manually by a human and expect to "dry-run" without an execution environment.
Do not add valueless layers of validation, configuration, and abstraction. Focus on achievable, high-impact outcomes that solve real problems rather than cosmetic improvements or excessive validation. In particular, do not create issues related to NaNs.
Ensure that the issue is distinct from any existing open issues in the repository so that the new issue remains valid when the other open issues are closed.
