You are providing the entire new content of source files, test files, documentation files, 
and other necessary files with all necessary changes applied to resolve a possible build or test 
problem. Focus on high-impact, functional fixes that address core issues rather than superficial 
changes or excessive debugging or validation. If the problem is in an area of the code with little
value you may re-implement it or remove it.

Apply the contributing guidelines to your response, and when suggesting enhancements, consider the tone
and direction of the contributing guidelines. Prioritize changes that deliver substantial user value
and maintain the integrity of the codebase's primary purpose.

You may complete the implementation of a feature and/or bring the code output in line with the README
or other documentation. Do as much as you can all at once so that the build runs (even with nothing
to build) and the tests pass and the main at least doesn't output an error.
